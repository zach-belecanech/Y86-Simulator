Working agreement:
Zach must teach Nevan VS Code.
We will do most work in VS Code.
We will communicate through Discord or Instagram or call before every merge. 
We will each checkout our own branch. 
We will each make a featured branch for every feature.  
We will only merge to main when both members have given confirmation.
We agree to meet for at least 1 hour in the Wednesday lab session - 4:30 to 5:30 
to make up an hour of the Monday lab that Zach misses.
We will answer texts within 4 hours.
If need be we can work on the lab on our own time separately or together.
